# PayFit - Software Engineering | Front-end challenge

This repository has been setup with the following tech:

- React
- TailwindCSS

You have three endpoints, providing posts, comments and users on a JSON format.

-> https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
-> https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
-> https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Your goal here is to write a very simple React App in less than 4 hours (no need to spend more time than that on this task), displaying the data coming from the Typicode API.

For example, a list of posts and a dropdown showing the comments for each post and a fake link to the profile of the user that wrote this review.

You're completely free about the UX and the UI and we encourage you to do it your way. Feel free to implement any feature that you find interesting or fun (drag n drop, physics or anything else!).

Don't spend too much time thinking about original features, what we expect here is something clean and simple.

You can use any extra library for styling, HTTP requests, drag n drop etc. This repo has been setup with TailwindCSS because we use it a lot at PayFit, but you can use vanilla CSS or any other lib. :)

Good luck!
